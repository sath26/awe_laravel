                    When I first started Felt Ball Rug, as a part time project, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting up to. All I wanted to do was give something back to the community, where I grew up when I was a little kid. By choosing to work with felt ball rug, I got the opportunity to work with some of the most amazing people in Nepal, mostly from the marginalised and underprivileged community who's had no education, totally dependant on others with huge family commitments. Seeing their lives slowly change because of this little opportunity they've been given, I now know why this is truly amazing. It's not so much about what we do, but more about why we do it. So with your love and support, we hope to make more impact in the future. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LOVE AND SUPPORT.
